          In the fall of 2014, Easy Eddy's was conceived as a simple firewood
          business. I would cut fallen trees on people's properties in the
          Rockford and Loves Park area for no charge, then I would split the
          wood with a maul and sell it by the facecord.

          Over the next three years, I continued to sell firewood and began
          charging a small fee for tree removals. During this time I was working
          a regular job in machining, but I married my wife Taylor and had a
          continued need for additional income. Cutting trees down became a
          great passion of mine as I gradually accumulated the equipment and
          experience necessary to apply more skilled techniques to the falling
          process.

          In 2017 I purchased my first F-150, and began doing full tree removals
          in Rockford and surrounding areas including Cherry Valley, Machesney
          Park, Roscoe, Caledonia, and even Beloit. In the fall of that year I
          finally quit my full time job and struck out with full dedication to
          my own business, which I licensed as Easy Eddy's Trees. I purchased a
          million dollars of liability insurance and continued to provide
          affordable pricing at every quote. Throughout the first warm season in
          2018, my business relied upon landscaping and lawn care to bolster
          sales, but the tree business was clearly the path forward.

          I purchased an old F-450 diesel flatbed truck from a landscaper near
          Poplar grove late in 2018, and was able to relieve my F-150 from many
          of its extreme duties.... That was one of the best purchases I ever
          made for Easy Eddy's Trees. The F-150 was not well suited for this
          kind of heavy load carrying, but I continued to use it with a custom
          wooden truck bed that I built myself.

          Within six months from that time, the frame on my half-ton pickup was
          broken in half from overloading, and I purchased a more suitable truck
          for this work, a Ram 3500. In that same period of time, I purchased a
          Bandit 1290 drum-fed brush chipper and hired an employee to drive the
          second truck. I had become engaged in more technical jobs and was
          forming a clearer understanding of safe climbing, rigging, and
          removals. At that time we were moving and loading all wood and limbs
          by hand with no machinery to assist.

          Our need for a dump truck was met by an old Chevy K3500 which was for
          sale by another tree company. Up until we purchased that truck, we
          unloaded every chunk of wood by hand and every bit of wood chips with
          grain shovels. You can imagine the intensity of the labor that was
          done on a daily basis. <br />
          The business grew quickly as we continued to develop our skill set and
          make connections in tree care throughout the Rockford region. The big
          block Chevy had a castastrophic drivetrain failure, so I had the dump
          bed and hydraulic system installed onto my flatbed F-450. That fall,
          Easy Eddy's purchased a dump trailer to haul and dump wood. This was a
          great improvement to efficiency and increased our capacity to remove
          large trees.

          Spring of 2021 was the beginning of a new era as I purchased the
          Bobcat MT100 mini track loader! These became very exciting times for
          the business. Now, instead of suffering countless hours of laborious
          lifting, cutting, throwing, and wheelbarrow pushing, we were able to
          let a machine handle the heavy work for us! Large trees have become
          much less of a challenge with the aid of this priceless piece of
          machinery, which fits through a standard 36-inch gate and is rated to
          lift and carry 1000 lbs! I also purchased a stump grinder attachment
          for the Bobcat, sufficient to handle most small and medium stump
          removal jobs.

          There were some serious setbacks in 2021, including the engine failure
          of our Bandit 1290 chipper. I was forced to purchase another chipper,
          which is a much safer Morbark M12R that has hydraulic feed rollers and
          an emergency reverse bar to keep my workers safe during operation. We
          are now able to feed the wood chipper with the Bobcat, which provides
          an additional boost in efficiency for tree removals and trimming.
          Throughout the time that I have been operating as Easy Eddy's Tree
          Service, I have continued to develop and grow as a tree climber. I
          have learned to assess trees for certain diseases or conditions that
          are common to the Northern Illinois region, as well as how to properly
          prune trees for human safety, local codes, aesthetics, overall health,
          and longevity.

          The year 2023 started off in February with a massive ice storm that
          ripped off countless limbs and took down trees all around Winnebago
          County. We were there through it all, with freezing rain and icy
          weather not preventing us from serving our customers.In April there
          was a powerful wind storm that came through the Rockford area, pushing
          down many trees. We removed trees from the roof of people's homes and
          cleaned up fallen limbs for a long time after that. Many trees were
          damaged from this storm but did not fail until some time later. We
          offer free inspections on trees that are suspected of being
          compromised, and we always provide a detailed description of the
          problem if there is one, as well as a recommended treatment plan and
          risk assessment.

          This year we also made a great connection with a contractor who was
          able to bring our business to the next level by reliably providing
          stump grinding service as well as contracting highly skilled ground
          labor and machinery operation. Adrian is the owner of El Toro Stump
          Grinding and covers the entire Rockford region with affordable and
